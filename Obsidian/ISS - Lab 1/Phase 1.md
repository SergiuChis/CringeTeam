# Phase 1

## Setting up the papers

In the first phase, each person interested to submit a proposal **create its own user account** fulfilling the information required (the name, affiliation, email address). Once the account is validated, the submitter logins, **submit the abstract** and fulfills the meta-information required: the name of the proposal, the keywords, the topics, the possible list of authors and their meta-information). Depending on the conference **it is possible to upload also the full paper** (usually a file in .pdf or .msword format). Uploading proposals can be done before the deadline mentioned on the conference site and on the "Call for papers". It is possible to have **two different deadlines**: one for the abstract and another for the proposal. Until each deadline, users may upload **new versions** both for the abstract and the paper.
