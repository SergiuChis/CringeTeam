# Phase 3

## Setting up the conference

The third phase concerns the conference activities - mainly papers' presentation. Depending on the number of participants and of accepted papers, the conference is structured on different sections, some of them organized in parallel. Each section is supervised by a session chair which in the most cases is a member of the Program Committee (PC member) including the chair/co-chairs. Authors presenting their accepted papers are named speakers. Participants to each section are: chair, speakers and listeners. In order to assign the most appropriate rooms for each section, in case of important conferences (having hundreds of participants) these are invited to specify which are the sections they intend to participate in. A speaker cannot be the chair of the section in which she/he present his paper. Usually, before the presentation, speakers upload on the conference site the content of the presentation by means of a .pdf or .ppt(x) file.
